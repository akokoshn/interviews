1. media_sdk (intel) ~ 5 years: library for quick encode/decode/process video - https://github.com/Intel-Media-SDK/MediaSDK
     worked on bug fix (hang, corruption, performance. memory leak), enable new feature (like video wall), directly communicate with stack holders try to solve issues with respect actual resources.
     support operation systems: windows, linux, android
     main languages: C, C++(11), perl, C#
     technologies: intel amplifies (profiler), gdb, VS 2017
   auto optimization framework based on halide ~ 2 years - https://github.com/halide/Halide
     enable internal features
     working on improvement performance of algorithm written on halide, including analize LLVM IR, GPU memory access, .... Enabled special optimization on level of generation IR.
     develop auto otimizaton tools based on OpenTuner(https://github.com/jansel/opentuner) and auto schedule plugin
     main languages: C, C++(11), Python, OpenCL
2. https://github.com/akokoshn/interviews/tree/master/company/freq_dict
3. Git (> 6 years), once have been used SVN.
4. Linux is the main build system (target - android, build on Linux), but on work desctop - windows.
   familiar with ssh (just main commands), vim (vi), gcc (also use clang), some experince with gbd
5. Not so much experience: just use in projects like OpenTuner (see github), and some internall small projects - only simpl cases (connect add record or select).
   Used MySQL, Mongo(once more 3 years ago)
   Your select ask "id" and "price" from table goods for all records with "category_id" = 123
6. Python, PHP, perl, bash.
   Would like resolve task with using python
   Has an experince in enabling build/deploy system on python, also works on internal version of OpenTuner(see github)
7. Small experince web developing:
       simple site PHP with local apach (registry/login)
       HTML5 games/tools (javascript)
8. media_sdk(see github):
       > 2000000 lines code
       support windows, linux, android
       includes dynamic libraryes, exacutable tools, VS integration plugin, windows installer
       team > 100 peoples (only developers)
9. Have AI cources in university. Now communicate with AI team (improve sub algorithms, like convalution).
   Have general understanding how it works, requirments for learn data set, design of NN. Alo have some experience with tools like pytorch.
   Classifier produce discret values (like 1 or 2), regressor - continuos value (float in [0,1] for example). In both cases can be used generally same NN excluding the latest layer.
10. avito.ru -> proxy -> xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -> load html page ->process user requests (PHP post/get for example)
11. Optimization of OpenCL memory access: merge loads, sliding window
12. a. C/C++(11), python
    b. C/C++(11,17,20), C#, Java, PHP, javascript, Python
